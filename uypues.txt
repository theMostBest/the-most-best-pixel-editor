~ issues with locations ~

1. the weird offset issue with the canvas:
	
	for some reason, if i dont add offset to the canvas sprite, there appears
	to be a weird margin on the top left sides. so i added an offset, and it worked!
	
	until... i noticed that the image size decreased by ‚ù∂ pixel. ikr, s h o c k i n g.
	so i changed the code to add one pixel the imageSize in the _ready function
	to make it seem like there was no issue. 
	
	but did u rlly think the issue would go away. of course not! if u export the image,
	you will have to crop the image to 1 pixel smaller then the size the image
	"technically" is. you know what i mean, right?
	
	anyways, make sure to fix these issues.
