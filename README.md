# ✨ the most best pixel editor ✨ ![GitHub last commit (branch)](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/theMostBest/the-most-best-pixel-editor/master)

![tmbge_design-01](https://github.com/theMostBest/the-most-best-pixel-editor/assets/72400519/c8099bdb-1de5-403a-9f0d-70a86d35b644)

made using godot, this pixel editor aims to be frequently updated, and add as many tools as needed to make a perfect pixel editor. the core value of this project is to have as much progress as possible so that github can always say that the last commit was only a few days ago. 🥳🥳🥳

this git repo is a WIP, so there are no releases... yet, but we are willing to get contributors in our pre-pre-alpha stage 🥇

*legally, we cant claim to be the most best pixel editor.* i just liked the name, so i named it that way 🙃

# features (wip) 🤩

👎 not added
👍 added

1. just like how in godot where you can make a player with many nodes, you can combine "nodes" (images) to make a completed image. [👎] 
2. easy way to help people create their own brushes to use in their project. [👎] 
3. by using the "node" system, you can make tilemaps easier. [👎]
4. blending types (additive, subtractive, multiply, etc..) [👎] 
5. palette importing and creation (support of many palette formats) [👎] 
6. pixel perfect drawing (no jagged lines) [👎]

*sigh.... im still working on them, dont u see how recent the most recent commit is?*
